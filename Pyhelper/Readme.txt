
PyHelper is a module that provides both text-to-speech and speech-to-texts methods through the Helper class.
To install the libraries needed to run the program, execute the commands below in the terminal:

# For the speech-to-text libraries:
    pip install SpeechRecognition

# For the text-to-speech libraries:
    pip install pyttsx3


To get a quick feel for how the program might work, run the PyHelper_demo.py file in VSCode
and say "Hi Alexa" followed by a command when the "Alexa:Listening..." prompt comes up on the terminal. 
(The default name given is Alexa, but it can be changed to whatever we would ant to chang it to.)
